Quark theme for HamsterCMS adapted for DOS LINKS browser

To use a template, create an **quark** folder in the **templates** folder, only index.html file there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

![this is what theme looks like](https://github.com/turboblack/quark_theme_for_HamsterCMS/blob/main/quark.png)

to change footer - edit **footer.txt** in the **includes** folder
Using the same principle, edit **about.txt** and replace the information there with your own.
file with links create and fill in **links.txt**

I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS
